# SolarSystem

3D Star and Planet Visualization
This project presents an interactive 3D visualization of a solar system, built using Three.js. It features a central star, multiple planets with their moons and rings, an asteroid belt, a background of distant stars, and a dynamic nebula. Users can explore the solar system in two distinct camera modes: Orbit Mode and Spaceship Mode.

Features
Central Star (Sun): A glowing central star illuminating the system.

Nine Planets: Includes Mercury, Venus, Earth (with night lights), Mars, Jupiter, Saturn (with rings), Uranus, Neptune (with faint rings), and Pluto.

Moons: Earth's Moon, Mars's Phobos and Deimos, and Jupiter's four Galilean moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto).

Planetary Rings: Detailed rings for Saturn and Neptune.

Asteroid Belt: A dynamic belt of asteroids between Mars and Jupiter.

Background Elements: A field of twinkling stars and a vibrant, organic nebula cloud.

Magnetic Field Lines: Toggleable magnetic field lines for all celestial bodies, visualizing their magnetic influence.

Two Camera Modes:

Orbit Mode: Orbit around the central star or any selected planet.

Spaceship Mode: Pilot a spaceship through the solar system with free movement and mouse-look.

Interactive Controls:

Mouse Drag: Rotate the camera in Orbit Mode.

Mouse Wheel: Zoom in/out in Orbit Mode.

Click on Planet: Focus the camera on a specific planet in Orbit Mode.

Number Keys (0-9): Quickly focus on the Sun (0) or individual planets (1-9).

Dedicated UI Buttons: Buttons for toggling magnetic field lines, switching to spaceship mode, and releasing camera focus.

WASD Keys (Spaceship Mode): Move the spaceship forward, backward, left, and right.

Mouse Movement (Spaceship Mode): Steer the spaceship.

Responsive Design: Adapts to different screen sizes.

How to Run
Save the Code: Save the provided HTML code as an .html file (e.g., solar_system.html).

Open in Browser: Open the solar_system.html file using a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).

The visualization will load automatically.
